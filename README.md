### Aeroplane Chess

This is the final project of the CS102A course of SUSTech `2020F`

It scored 100 + bonus part

Although its main logic code is totally a pile of B.S.[^1] 
(I can't even believe anyone is willing to read it),
some modules may still have some value for your reference.

Anyway, the most practical advice I can give you is,
**DO NOT** consider the robustness of your program,
not to mention performance optimization.

All you have to do in this course is adding as many features as possible.

In fact, even if there are obvious bugs in part of the operation,
as long as the accurate status can be reflected in the overall operation of the program,
you may still get a high score.

**`TIP`** Make good use of *inheritance*

**`TIP`** You'd better not write code after 1 a.m.

### Best regards.
